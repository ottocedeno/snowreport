# SnowReport

Welcome to SnowReport! A terminal based application that reports expected snowfall at the world's best ski and snowboard resorts.

## Installation

The current verion of SnowReport is in beta and can be cloned down to your local environment.

In terminal, type:

    $ git clone git@github.com:ottocedeno/snowreport.git

## Usage

Run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.

Run `bin/snowreport` to start a session of SnowReport.

While the application is running, you can type the following commands:

- `TOP TEN` To produce a list of the top mountains.
- `HELP` To reprint the instructions.
- `EXIT` To exit the application.

The fun is in selecting individual mountains from the `TOP TEN` list.  You can select each mountain to see more information about that particular mountain by simply typing it's full name.

For example:  If 'Whistler Blackcomb' is listed, you can select it by typing `whistler blackcomb`.

## Development
